Todo list. 
1.	Get Henry up to speed.
2.	Brief overview of how the game works
3.	Brief overview of how the microcontroller works.
4.	Explain my classes and functions real quick.
Start the procedure.
Anthony: Hook up MCU and test code that is already written. If finished, then work on hardware design (mainly how the MCUs will interact with each other) Test code as it becomes available and help others as they need it.
Chirag: Improve shipset.cpp/shipset.h Add features as they seem fit (ships turn when they reach the edge, proper collision detection, etc…) If you don’t want to code or you are waiting for stuff to happen, help me with Eagle software and building PCBs. Also work on I2C communication if possible.
Henry: Given the opponents whereabouts, develop code for the attack board. Light up LEDs on the attack board when you enter a coordinate (row, column). Then allow it to turn red if hit and green if miss. If finished work on the I2C communication with other MCUs.
